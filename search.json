Part of my reserch work focussed on ModelScan: It is an OSS project that scans Machine Learning (ML) models to determine if they contain unsafe code, i.e.Â scans for Model Serialization Attack (MSA).\n\nBuild a proof of concept for model serialization attacks for the aforementioned ML libraries\nWrote Jupyter Notebooks to demonstrate MSA on Tensorflow, Keras, PyTorch, XGBoost models.\nDevelop ModelScan to detect model serialization attacks without loading the model for the aforementioned ML frameworks"
